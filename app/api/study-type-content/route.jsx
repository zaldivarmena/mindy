The mind map should have:
1. A central main topic node at the top (root node)
2. Multiple primary branches (at least 5-7 main concepts) vertically aligned below the root node
3. Secondary branches from each primary branch (2-3 subtopics per main concept) continuing downward
4. Tertiary branches where appropriate (deeper details) at the bottom levels

The structure should follow a vertical tree distribution with the root node at the top and all branches flowing downward in a hierarchical manner. This vertical alignment is critical for proper visualization.

Each node should have a concise label and a brief description explaining the concept.

Return in JSON format with the following structure: 
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "1", 
      "label": "Main Topic",
      "type": "main",
      "description": "Detailed description of the main topic",
      "level": 0  // Root level
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "label": "Primary Branch 1",
      "type": "primary",
      "description": "Description of this main concept",
      "level": 1  // First level below root
    },
    {
      "id": "3",
      "label": "Secondary Branch 1.1",
      "type": "secondary",
      "description": "More detailed information about this subtopic",
      "level": 2  // Second level
    },
    {
      "id": "4",
      "label": "Tertiary Branch 1.1.1",
      "type": "tertiary",
      "description": "Specific details about this concept",
      "level": 3  // Third level
    }
  ],
  "connections": [
    {
      "source": "1",
      "target": "2",
      "direction": "down"  // Explicitly indicate vertical flow
    },
    {
      "source": "2",
      "target": "3",
      "direction": "down"
    },
    {
      "source": "3",
      "target": "4",
      "direction": "down"
    }
  ]
}

Ensure all nodes have unique IDs and that connections properly represent the hierarchical relationship between concepts. The vertical tree structure is essential - all nodes at the same level should be horizontally aligned, and each level should be clearly below its parent level.`;
